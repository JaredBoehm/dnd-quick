## Description

In D&D one of the most time consuming setup processes, and potential hurdles for people new to the D&D, is creating your character sheet. 
D&D Quick is a small web application that drastically simplifies this process by mostly automating the steps needed to correctly fill out a character sheet. 
It's developed with the primary goal of getting you ready for the table with just a few easy to understand clicks.
