    <h1 class="text-xl mb-6">About Us</h1>
    <p class="max-w-2xl self-center mb-10 mx-10">
        D&D Quick was developed by some regular nerds with a passion for role playing games. 
        We made D&D Quick because we want to see as many people experience the hobbies we love as possible. 
        We've all been new to something and it can be confusing to understand what's going on or even what you need to do to get started.
        Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry for new players and take away as much of that confusion as possible.
        So create your character, dive in, and have fun!
