Get stats for Strength, Dexterty, Constitution, intelligence, wisdom, charisma
you get these stats by roling 4 d6 dice and removing the lowest dice and repeat 7 times then the player can take the 6 numbers and imput them themselves or have them randomly imputed
Modifier = stat number - 10 then divide by 2 (always round number down)
Proficiency bonus is calculated based on lvl 
hit points at frist level, add your constitution modifier to the highest possible total of your class's assigned hit dice. ex clerik has a hit die of d8 and maybe you have a con modifier of 1 so hit points would be 9
Armor class is dexterity modifier plus 10
proficiency (unsure api will take care of)
initiative modifier = to dexterity modifier
speed = character based

Example of game play
Ex:1 Purchasing Weapon
DM "your character walks into a shop and sees swords, shields, armor and other weapons of all kind." 
DM Playing Shopkeeper "hello my good sir see anything that catches your eye today" 
Player "hmm that sword over there looks very cool how much would that be" 
Dm Playing shopkeeper "that would be 10 silver coins"
Player to DM "is there anything special about the sword"
Dm to Player "make an insight check, roll a d 20"
Player rolls a 18 
DM to player "the sword seems to have hiden powers inside of it but the shopkeeper doesn't seem to know this"
Player to Shopkeeper "ill take the sword"

Ex:2 Combat
player comes upon a skeleton in the dungeon
DM "roll initiative"
(the player would roll a d20 and the skeleton would have a set initiative. whoever has the highest initiative will determine order of play)
player rolls a 20 skeleton has initiative of 12 so player goes first
DM to Player "how would you like to attack"
Player "I swing my sword at the skeleton"
DM to Player "roll to hit"
Player (rolls d20 and gets a 15+2(proficiency bonus) the skeleton has an armor class of 10 so the attack hits)
DM to player "your attack hits roll for damage"
Player rolls 1d8 (adds any modifiers) and does that amount of damage to the skeleton.
